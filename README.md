Loan Prediction 

The objective of predicting whether a loan is approved or not is to assist financial institutions, such as banks or lending companies, in making informed decisions about loan applications. By analyzing various factors provided in the loan application, including applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, employment status, etc., machine learning models can predict the likelihood of a loan being approved or rejected.
